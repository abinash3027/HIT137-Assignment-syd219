until about days pta when he began experiencing intermittent nausea he had episodes of coffee ground emesis and episode of tarry black stool in the morning of admission he reports some lightheadedness which is not new but denies frank hematemesis brbpr abdominal pain fever chills significant increases in his abdominal girth he denies drinking or medication non compliance he also reports taking naproxen for back pain times a day in the recent past in the ed his vitals were on ra he was given l ns iv protonix mg iv started on an octreotide drip he had guaiac positive brown stool on rectal exam he was seen by the liver fellow in the ed who felt this was unlikely a variceal bleed and recommended work up for infection an ng tube was attempted however patient was unable to tolerate it in the ed abdominal ultrasound was done which showed a patent portal vein scant ascites but not enough to tap bp dropped to pt transferred to micu for hemodynamic monitoring in the micu pt was given prbc
